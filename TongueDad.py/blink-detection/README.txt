MOUTH CONTROL
----------------------------------------------
Description -
	Mouth Control is an application to control your mouse cursor using 
	only your face, and more specifically, your bottom lip.

Usage -
	Unzip the provided archive.
	Make sure both the executable and .dat are in the same folder.
	Run the executable. If your device has two cameras, you may need to run the alternate executable to grab the correct camera.

	Look at your screen blankly and press c to grab your calibration. You should now be able to control your mouse.
	You will see the face, eyebrow, eye and lip tracking overlaid on the image.
	To left click, close your eyes for about half a second.
	To right click, raise your eyebrows.
	To move your cursor, move your bottom lip around. It works similar to the TrackPoints on business laptops.

	If at any time you need to recalibrate, press c with the image window open. If it's a clicking issue, 
	possibly open your eyes a little wider when calibrating. You must keep your face still, or that will trigger the cursor movement.
	To quit, make sure you're in the image window, and press q.
	
	If you prefer to run it by python source, you need Python 3.6, and you need to install opencv, numpy, scipy, imutils and dlib as modules.
