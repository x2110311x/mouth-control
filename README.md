Houston to mouth control.

You lost your arm in a freak accident, and you need to use your computer.
You could use speech recognition, but that's clunky and doesn't control your mouse.

What's the solution? Mouth control. You control your mouse using your bottom lip, and click with your eyes!

Maybe you didn't lose your arms. Maybe you just can't move them, or you really need to keep them on your keyboard. Use your mouth!
